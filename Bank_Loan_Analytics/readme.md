### KPI #03 ‚Äì Total Payment by Verification Status

üîç Definitions:
- **Verified**: Income or identity fully verified through documents or system checks.
- **Not Verified**: No formal verification; relies on user-provided data only.
- **Source Verified**: Income source is confirmed (e.g., employer or bank), but not full verification.
* * *

<img width="567" height="383" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80ff2cb1-a276-4fd8-8bba-c9b489b56256" />


* * *
### üß† **Key Insights:**
* * *

1. **Verified accounts** contribute the **highest total payment**:

   * **219.89M**, which is **45.55%** of the total.
   * Indicates that verified users are the most financially active.

2. **Not Verified** accounts contribute:

   * **153.54M**, or **31.81%**.
   * This is substantial, showing a sizable portion of payments come from unverified users ‚Äî possibly an opportunity or risk.

3. **Source Verified** accounts contribute the **least**:

   * **109.27M**, which is **22.64%**.
   * While smaller, this still represents over one-fifth of all payments.

* * *
### üí° **Recommendations:**
* * *
* **Verified users** are your **highest-value segment** ‚Äî focus on **retention** and **upselling**.
* **Not Verified** users could be a **conversion opportunity** ‚Äî incentivize them to verify to increase trust and potentially boost payment volumes.
* Investigate if **Source Verified** has stricter criteria or limited access ‚Äî there's room to grow this segment.
